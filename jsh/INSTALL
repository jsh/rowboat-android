To get these installed, just type "make."

To make the .vimrc file useful,
  $ sudo apt-get install vim-gnome

I make all my local mods in a ~/.bash-local file, rather than scattering them through ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash-profile, and so on.

To make the .bash* files useful, add this line to your ~/.bashrc
  if [ -f ~/.bash-local ]; then source ~/.bash-local; fi
