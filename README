Scripts to set up and build rowboat-android.

These are mostly just copied from the TI instructions and tweaked
to do things like fix typos.

The subdirectory jsh/ contains files I want in my development environment.
I doubt anyone else will want them.

The validate-end-to-end.t script runs the build* and get* scripts in the right order.

I include the repo command because, ..., well, ... I do. So there.
